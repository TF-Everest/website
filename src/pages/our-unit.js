					We offer members three dedicated ARMA 3 servers which are available for use 24 hours a day.
					<br /><br />
					Each server runs our in-house modpack which is continuously tested to maintain stability and is easily installed via the Steam Workshop.
					<br /><br />
					We offer members comprehensive training that allows any level of player to take part in and enjoy the military simulation experience.
					<br /><br />
					All of our servers use the ACE Advanced Medical system which has been carefully tuned to provide a immersive gameplay experience with dedicated medical personnel.
					<br /><br />
					We use the Advanced Combat Radio Environment (ACRE2) to provide a realistic and detailed simulation of a combat radio environment.
					<br /><br />
					All of our game environments enforce realism standards including the removal of Crosshairs, Virtual Waypoints and Hostile Identity Glint.

			<div href="#" className="half-row light-grey-block" style={{ flex: 1 }}>
				<h2 className="homepage-hero-subtitle">Out of Game</h2>
				<p className="homepage-hero-body">
					We build and maintain custom software to manage the administration of the unit to ensure that every member's progress is tracked and rewarded.
					<br /><br />
					All of our training is backed by extensive written documentation allowing members to review concepts at their own pace.
					<br /><br />
					We maintain a meaningful rank system with protections against nepotism and unfair promotion. All members are processed equally to ensure a fair and consistent promotion cycle.
					<br /><br />
					Our group hosts a dedicated team of JAG (Judge Advocate General) members who work independently to the Chain of Command. Any member who feels they have been treated unfairly by the Chain of Command may refer the issue to the JAG and be given a chance to speak their case.
					<br /><br />
					We operate a freely accessible teamspeak allowing members to enjoy the social aspect of the group by playing other games or simply conversing in some of the dedicated channels provided.
